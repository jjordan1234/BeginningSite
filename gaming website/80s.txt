<h1>The rise of the Arcade</h1>
<p>Through most of the eighties and even the early nineties, the scene was always the same.</br>
 Somewhere in your local mall, a noisy little store would sit in some corner. In it, groups of </br>
people would crowd around strange looking cabinets, trying to catch a glimpse of the action. the local</br>
arcade was more than just a place to hang out. It was a place to gather with other people who shared your</br>
passion for for gaming, whether they be friends or just people who happened to ask if they could join your</br>
game. There was something about the local arcade that just felt right. Sure, they were not always the cleanest</br>
places, and some were definitely not what you would call safe, but to gamers growing up in that time period, the </br>
arcades will always hold a place in their hearts.</p>

<h2>The rise of the NES, Sega, and the beginning of the console wars</h2>
<p>
Nintendo's 8-bit video game console, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), known in Japan as the Family Computer</br>
 or Famicom, was introduced after the video game crash of 1983, and was instrumental in revitalizing the industry. It </br>
 enjoyed a long lifespan and dominated the market during the rest of the decade. In the late 80s, Nintendo's dominance was</br>
 threatened by newer, technologically superior consoles. 1987, NEC and Hudson Soft released the PC Engine, and a year </br>
later, Sega released the 16 bit Mega Drive. Both were introduced in North America in 1989, where they were respectively marketed</br>
 as the "TurboGrafx-16" and the "Genesis." The Sega Master System was the first of Sega's consoles to see widespread distribution</br> 
outside of Japan, and went head-to-head with the Nintendo Entertainment System (the international version of the Famicom) across the</br>
 world. Sega was unsuccessful at dethroning Nintendo in the key markets of Japan and North America.  </p>
