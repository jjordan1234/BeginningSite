units sold as of May 2006. Microsoft's second console, the Xbox 360, was released</br> 
in 2005 and has sold over 77.2 million consoles worldwide as of April 2013. The</br> 
successor to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft's most recent console, the Xbox One, was</br> 
revealed in May 2013.The Xbox One has been released in 21 markets in total, with</br>

<h2> That's Wii diculous</h2>
<p>
The Wii is a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 19, 2006. As a seventh</br> 
generation console, the Wii competed with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. Nintendo</br>
states that its console targets a broader demographic than that of the two others.As of the first</br>
quarter of 2012, the Wii leads its generation over PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in worldwide sales,</br>
with more than 101 million units sold; in December 2009, the console broke the sales record for a</br>
single month in the United States.The Wii introduced the Wii Remote controller, which can be used </br>
as a handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions. Another feature of</br> 
the console is the now defunct WiiConnect24, which enabled it to receive messages and updates over </br>
the Internet while in standby mode.Like other seventh-generation consoles, it features a game </br>
download service, called Virtual Console, which features emulated games from past systems.
