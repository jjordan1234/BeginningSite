<h2>The emergence of fighting games in the arcade</h2>
<p>
In 1991, Capcom evolved the fighting game genre with the well-received</br> 
sequel, Street Fighter 2. Not only did it bring big business to arcades,</br> 
it also gave the SNES a boost with a perfect home port almost a year</br> 
later. As much as we enjoyed Street Fighter 2, Midway took fighting to a</br> 
whole new level with the entertaining Mortal Kombat, a fun martial arts</br> 
brawler with fatal consequences. Ripping out someone's spine with Sub-Zero</br> 
was legendary. The home versions were mixed as the SNES version was a </br>
sweat-fest, while the Genesis version was perfect, provided you entered</br>
 the ABACABB blood code.</p>
</br>


<h3>Emergence of the Playstation</h3>
<p>
PlayStation was the brainchild of Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive who had just</br>
finished managing one of the company's hardware engineering divisions at that</br> 
time and would later be dubbed as The Father of the PlayStation.The console's</br> 
origins date back to 1988 where it was originally a joint project between </br>
Nintendo and Sony to create a CD ROM for the Super Famicom.Although Nintendo </br>
denied the existence of the Sony deal as late as March 1991,Sony revealed</br>
a Super Famicom with a built-in CD ROM drive, that incorporated Green Book </br>
technology or CD i, called Play Station also known as SNES-CD at the Consumer</br>
Electronics Show in June 1991. However, a day after the announcement at CES, </br>
Nintendo announced that it would be breaking its partnership with Sony, opting</br>
to go with Philips instead but using the same technology.The deal was broken</br>
by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an agreement on how revenue would</br>
be split between the two companies.The breaking of the partnership infuriated</br>
Sony President Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the</br> 
responsibility of developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo.</br>
